  <p>Wexford Obal Karr was born February 6th, 1921 at home in Detroit, Marion County, Alabama on what is now designated as Karr Road. On the day of his birth, his mother was assisted by two family friends - one on each side of her as the baby was born. The doctor arrived after it was all over. His mother Mary Etta said the doctor still charged them the $3 house call charge. Wexford is photographed above, circa 1926, on his tricycle with his favorite toy truck and car in the foreground.</p>
